I got a 3.99 GPA in High School.
I like playing tennis, soccer, and disc golf. I love reading. A Tale of Two Cities is my favorite book.

My biggest project was a collaboration with Peyton Bair (another student). It's called GeneralConferenceDownloader it is an HTML scraper made in Python that finds download links and pulls them and downloads them, renaming them and sorting them into a directory.
